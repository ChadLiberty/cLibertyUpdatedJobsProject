2. no install beyond the basics (sqlite, etc.)
3. The project should take the data from the API and store it in 
a data table 
4. I took Professor Santore's code from Sprint1 and built upon it for sprint 2. I think that I was able to 
create a table, but I was not clear on how to check it. The biggest problem with this sprint is that I was unsure of how
to get the API to save to the table. The tests cases are not 100% working either.
